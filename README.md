# Rust Sample Code

This repository serves as documentation for the code I wrote while learning Rust. The sample code is taken from:
1. [The Rust Programming Language, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/1718503105/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1689058222&refinements=p_27%3ASteve+Klabnik&s=books&sr=1-1&text=Steve+Klabnik)
99. [The Rust Official Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
